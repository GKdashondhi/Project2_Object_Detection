Aim of Project - To detect 2D objects using single shot detector (SSD).
                 Project will detect the object and a toggle button is also created on the frame to detect the desired object. 

Code - main.py and gui_buttons.py

pretrained CNN - dnn_model folder contains pre-trained model weights and claases.txt contains all the classes.

Dataset - coco dataset

Input Taken - From webcam to test the algorithm. 

Algorithm - You Only Look Once V4 (YOLOV4).

Output - output folder contains the output of the algorithm.
